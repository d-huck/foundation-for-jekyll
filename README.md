# dhuck's Foundation for Jekyll

This repository is a quick project start combining Foundation 6.5 with Jekyll 3.83. To get started, clone this repository and get to designing.

## Requirements and Instructions

This package uses gem to install its required packages. Before you can get started, installed the dependencies

```sh
gem install -g
```

Once everything is installed, you can monitor your site's design by typing the following command into the project directory. This will watch the directory for any changes and reload the browser window when the changes have finished rendering.

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

That's it! You're now building a site. Jekyll handles all of the sass building so there is no need to for extra steps like other repositories that have been posted,
